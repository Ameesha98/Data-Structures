# Data-Structures

A data structure is a *specialized* format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways. This repository contains the basic data structure programs written in C++.

### Prerequisites

You will need an IDE for running the c++ programs in your system.

## Verifying C++ programs

The document files with output have been attached with each folder so that you can verify the code with those sample test cases.
